          <h4>Searching for that special spider</h4>
          <article>
            North American tarantulas (50 species that fall under the genus Aphonopelma) have been known to travel up to a mile a long trek for a spider with legs the length of our fingers to find a mate. Usually, though, males prefer to stay within a few inches of their burrows.
            Once a tarantula finds a potential mate's burrow and fights off any other males for courtship rights, he does something akin to knocking on the front door: Burrows are covered by a silk web, so the suitor taps the web and tries to entice the female outside.

          <h4>A mob of horny tarantulas is prowling San Francisco</h4>
          <article>
            October is turning out to be a bad month to live in San Francisco. First, utilities company PG&E initiated wide-ranging Bay Area blackouts to protect against the possibility of wildfires. Now it seems the warmer weather is attracting thousands of tarantulas looking for mates, so residents will have to fight off horny spiders in the dark.
            To be fair, while tarantulas mostly come out at night during mating season, males can also be seen roaming around all hours to find a female for some lovin'.
            "San Francisco officials are warning residents to be on the lookout for thousands of giant male spiders," according to The Wall Street Journal. "The spiders aren't dangerous to people. In fact it's the other way around."

          <h4>Turquoise-Tinted Tarantula Discovered in Sri Lanka</h4>
          <article>
            The discovery of the iridescent spider, named Chilobrachys jonitriantisvansicklei, was first reported in the British Tarantula Society Journal.The arachnid was spotted because of its brilliant blue coloring, according to National Geographic, which described it as “fast and aggressive,” about 5 inches long and “big enough to comfortably hug a donut.”

            Turquoise-Tinted Tarantula Discovered in Sri Lanka
            The species is only the second member of its genus ever found in the South Asian country
            “When we first spotted them, I was in awe, lost for words,” lead researcher Ranil Nanayakkara, of the University of Kelaniya, told the magazine.The females are the showier, brightly colored spiders of the new species, while their male counterparts mirror other species of tarantula with black, brown or gray coloring. “The males are smaller and are mossy brown in color,” Nanayakkara said.

          <h4>The goliath birdeater</h4>
          <article>
            The Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) belongs to the tarantula family Theraphosidae. Found in northern South America, it is the largest spider in the world by mass and size, but it is second to the giant huntsman spider by leg span.[1] It is also called the Goliath bird-eating spider; the practice of calling theraphosids "bird-eating" derives from an early 18th-century copper engraving by Maria Sibylla Merian that shows one eating a hummingbird. Despite the spider's name, it only rarely preys on birds.

          <h4>Poecilotheria metallica</h4>
          Poecilotheria metallica has similar intricate geometric body coloration as other Poecilotheria species, but it is the only species in the genus to be covered in blue hair. While it is young, P. metallica is less chromatic, the coloring turns to blue as it matures. This blue is much less significant in the mature males. Males also have more slender bodies, and their legs are longer.

          <h4>Avicularia avicularia</h4>
          <article>
            Avicularia avicularia, sometimes called the pinktoe tarantula, is a species of tarantula native from Costa Rica to Brazil and the southern Caribbean. This species is sometimes called the Guyana pinktoe, common pinktoe, or South American pinktoe.
            The mature pinktoe tarantula has a dark-colored body and pinkish feet, hence its name. Juvenile specimens, however, have pinkish bodies and dark-colored feet. Pinktoe tarantulas undergo a reversal in their coloration as they approach adulthood at 4–5 years. They are sit-and-wait predators, with limited activity.[1]
            Being arboreal species, they require a relatively tall habitat with plenty of climbing space in captivity. They require a lot of moisture, along with ample ventilation to prevent molds from developing.
            They have a short lifespan and usually live between 7-9 years.[2]
            They are known to lure in their victims through the process of stationization, the act of remaining in a trance-like state until moment of attack. A full grown pinktoe tarantula can grow up to six inches in length. Their first reaction when threatened is usually to run or leap away, but they may react defensively if provoked (as with any theraphosid). Their venom is considered mild, even compared to other new-world tarantulas.
            Although this species is often rumoured to be communal, housing them in groups will almost inevitably lead to cannibalism over time.

          <h4>Avicularia</h4>
          <article>
            Avicularia is a genus of the family Theraphosidae containing various species of tarantulas. The genus is native to tropical South America. Each species in the genus has very distinguishable pink foot pads.
            One of the most notable features of the Avicularia species is their odd method of defense. When threatened, their first choice is to jump or run away as quickly as possible – occasionally, though, they will launch a jet of excrement at the perceived threat. Adults are capable of good accuracy and a range of 0.5–1 m (2 to 3 feet).
            There is also a belief that they may be the reason behind rumors of "flying spiders" in the rainforests they are native to, as they are quite adept at jumping. Their legs, however, prevent them from gaining much height in making a jump. Avicularia avicularia are among the tarantulas most commonly kept as pets.
